Hey folks! My name is Mike McDonald (he/him), and I'm a PM on [@Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot). I've worked previously at [@Stedi](https://github.com/stedi), [@covid-projections](https://github.com/covid-projections), [@Google](https://github.com/google), and [@Firebase](https://github.com/firebase). 

Here are some fun side projects I've worked on:
 - [Can I Upgrade My Flights](https://caniupgrade.flights)
 - [How Delayed is SFO](https://howdelayed.is/sfo) (or [its NSFW cousin](https://howfucked.is/sfo))

My [personal site](https://mikemcdonald.co) also has some fun content that spans travel, cocktails, cars, and more!
